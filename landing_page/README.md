Landing page I created.

You can check it out the `index.html` page by opening it on a browser. 

This was meant to be the landing page for my Github hosted [personal website]("https://jerry-ye-xu.github.io"), 
but I decided to go with a Jekyll-based blogging theme instead. 

You can still click on the links to get to the website though.
